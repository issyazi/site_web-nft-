                Cryptocurrency tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) are fungible, meaning 1 bitcoin is equal to any other bitcoin. 
                Each bitcoin is indistinguishable from any other bitcoin.
                </p> <p class = "intro_text">
                A non-fungible token (NFT) is a cryptographic asset — a unique digital token stored on a blockchain that 
                is distinguishable from any other token.
                </p> <p class = "intro_text">
                This property of uniqueness has inspired an industry around different use cases of NFTs 
                ranging from art to intellectual property and more.</p>

                    <h1 class = "intro_title1"> Non-Fungible Tokens </h1>

                Fungible assets are interchangeable with one another. A dollar can be traded for a dollar. A share of a company can be traded for another share. A bitcoin for a bitcoin. Fungible coins are indistinguishable from one another.
                </p> <p class = "intro_text">
                So what does it mean for something to be Non-Fungible? Non-fungible assets are unique. They are distinguishable from an asset even of a similar type. You can think of this like trading a piece of hand drawn art, for another piece of hand drawn art. They are both art - maybe even the same drawing, however they are completely different physical objects and unique pieces of art.
                </p> <p class = "intro_text">
                It is this ability to establish a completely unique digital “thing” that has brought so much value to creators and the web3 space over the past few years.
                </p> <p class = "intro_text">
                Today, NFTs most commonly take the form of digital art, collectibles, or access passes. All information related to that NFT is recorded on a blockchain where you can view the history of ownership, metadata information, as well as what the NFT represents. These items can be bought and sold using cryptocurrency or cash.
                </p> <p class = "intro_text">
                NFTs can be valued by the unique traits of the asset. Art NFTs can be evaluated by the traits of the design. Membership NFTs can be evaluated by the benefits of the membership. Each NFT can be valued as a class, as well as the unique traits of the NFT within that class.
                </p> <p class = "intro_text">
                Art NFTs can be photographed, copied or screenshot much like art you may see in a museum. However, these copies are not valued the same as the original piece.
                </p> <p class = "intro_text">
                NFTs, issued on a public ledger, are verifiable both in their uniqueness (non-fungibility) as well as their provenance. This means that a unique piece of art maintains its value independently to copies. A poster of the Mona Lisa is worth nothing compared to the original hanging in the Louvre.</p>
